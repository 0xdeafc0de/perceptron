# single-layer-perceptron
Minimal Single-layer perceptron example which is a great fit for educating ML

## Key Features
- Represents a single neuron with 3 inputs
- Trains using a simplified rule (gradient update without full error propagation)
- Uses sigmod activation function
- Trained on synthetic training data and test evaluation
- Goal - To learn 'x1 AND x2 (ignoring x3)'
